# MOS-6.1 — Review security production readiness

MOSDLC operation `review-security-production-readiness` · Phase 6 — Maintenance and improvements · Risk: low.
Common contract: `project-os-en/operations/README.md` (kernel resolution, live state, validation, non-authorization, fail-closed behavior, and secret safety).

- Surface: browser_chat
- Kernel: workflow.review_only · mode.review_only · output.status_result
- Evidence: evidence.repo_state
- PM approval: No (read-only)

**Does:** Review PRoject security for production readiness.
**For:** Detect security risks before production.
**How:** Review read-only OWASP and 8 domains on the current state.

**Variables**
- Required: TARGET_REPOSITORY
- Optional: PM_FEEDBACK_HUMANO, PM_QUESTION_HUMANO (PM feedback and questions are context only and never authorize an action)

**Safeguards**
- Strict security posture: describe sensitive surfaces only by variable name, command, path, or risk type; never expose secrets, `.env` values, tokens, or credentials.

**Deliver:** output.status_result. If evidence, scope, or approval is missing or ambiguous, fail closed: report with `output.status_result` and return the decision to the PM.

**Connections:** Previous: MOS-4.6. Next: MOS-6.7. Recommended: MOS-6.7.
